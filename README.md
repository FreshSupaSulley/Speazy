# Speazy

Causes death to those that speak the unspeakable.

## Nerds

Speazy uses [WhisperJni](https://github.com/GiviMAD/whisper-jni) to transcribe audio. It uses [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp), a C/C++ port of OpenAI's Whisper model. Therefore, WhisperJNI requires native libaries to be built for the target platform. The instructions are in the README.
